Event sourcing is a radically different way to create software models. Because
is it so different it is good to familiarize yourself with the concepts and
fundamental building blocks. Event sourcing itself may not be conceptually
difficult, but learning it is. This page collects learning material to help
you get aboard the event sourcing train. Enjoy!

## EventSourcery by Shawn McCool

The wonderful [Shawn McCool](https://twitter.com/ShawnMcCool) has released a [video course about event sourcing
on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQuwqoolg4aI6v1GvtRg3NgT0PBBHVqii). Even though the course is not about EventSauce, the concepts explained
in the course will be very much in line with the concepts that this library builds on.
